                    <p>I'm a 25-year-old who loves computers, history, and eSports. Most recently I have gotten into
                        watching a few different kinds of esports or "Electronic Sports."</p>
                    <p>Beyond gaming and esports, I played some sports in elementary and middle school. When I was
                        six
                        years old to about 10 years old I played baseball on a local team! I didn't have a position
                        since we were still basically learning the game to have fun, but I did hit a few good Home
                        Runs!
                        A few years later I delved into my first experience of Track and Field. I found out very
                        quickly
                        that I wasn't a runner or a jumper... However I did find that Shotput and Discus were right
                        up
                        my alley! Possible thanks to my experiencce in Baseball maybe? Who knows! I only did one
                        season
                        though as the next season ended abruptly thanks to a broken arm of mine...</p>
                    <p>After I had finished baseball, I found myself less interested in sports and more interested
                        in
                        Music! I picked up the violin at 11-years-old and played all the way through my Senior year
                        of
                        High School! Through my time playing an insturment in a group setting, I learned a lot about
                        confidence, cohesion, and cooperation. As tacky as that sounds, playing an instrument in
                        front
                        of a hundred or more people takes a lot of confidence. In order to be heard, you have to
                        play as
                        loud as the rest of the orchestra; and trust me, the audience can hear your mistakes. Every
                        player is a cog in the machine of the music and the conductor is merely the driver behind
                        the
                        wheel. If the musicians are ill-prepared and ignorant to the piece they're playing, the
                        entire
                        ensemble can fall apart from one musician's lack of practice.</p>
                    <p>In my time playing the violin I also learned a lot of history since so many pieces were
                        written
                        in different eras and played for certain events. Of course, the most famous orchestral
                        ensembles
                        are from Europe.</p>
                    <p>Expanding beyond than just musical history, I'm a sucker for war history between WWI and
                        WWII.
                        However, I've never been outside of the country. I've always wanted to go somewhere where I
                        can
                        actually stand where a pivotal historical battle or opera took place. The more history I
                        learn
                        the more I want to go to those places to compare the photos, instruments, and vehicles and
                        truly
                        appreciate how far we, as a civilization, have come since both the beautiful and awful
                        events
                        took place.</p>
