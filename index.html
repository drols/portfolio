                    <p>I'm a 24-year-old who loves computers, video games, history, and eSports. Most recently I have gotten into watching a few different kinds of esports or "Electronic Sports." It's a fairly new interest of mine considering I never followed any kind of actual athletic sports but I never knew how invested I could become into something that seems so bizarre. It's gotten to the point where I'm looking to go to as many events and watch as many streams as I can fit into my schedule. That being said, I'm not much of a thrill seeker but when there is something that truly excites me, I don't think there is anything that will prevent me from satisfying that excitement.</p>        
                    <p>Beyond gaming and esports, I played some sports in elementary and middle school. When I was six years old to about 10 years old I played baseball on a local team! I didn't have a position since we were still basically learning the game to have fun, but I did hit a few good Home Runs! A few years later I delved into my first experience of Track and Field. I found out very quickly that I wasn't a runner or a jumper... However I did find that Shotput and Discus were right up my alley! Possible thanks to my experiencce in Baseball maybe? Who knows! I only did one season though as the next season ended abruptly thanks to a broken arm of mine...</p>
                    <p>After I had finished baseball, I found myself less interested in sports and more interested in Music! I picked up the violin at 11-years-old and played all the way through my Senior year of High School! Through my time playing an insturment in a group setting, I learned a lot about confidence, cohesion, and cooperation. As tacky as that sounds, playing an instrument in front of a hundred or more people takes a lot of confidence. In order to be heard, you have to play as loud as the rest of the orchestra; and trust me, the audience can hear your mistakes. Every player is a cog in the machine of the music and the conductor is merely the driver behind the wheel. If the musicians are ill-prepared and ignorant to the piece they're playing, the entire ensemble can fall apart from one musician's lack of practice.</p>
                    <p>In my time playing the violin I also learned a lot of history since so many pieces were written in different eras and played for certain events. Of course, the most famous orchestral ensembles are from Europe.</p>
                    <p>Expanding beyond than just musical history, I'm a sucker for war history between WWI and WWII. However, I've never been outside of the country. I've always wanted to go somewhere where I can actually stand where a pivotal historical battle or opera took place. The more history I learn the more I want to go to those places to compare the photos, instruments, and vehicles and truly appreciate how far we, as a civilization, have come since both the beautiful and awful events took place.</p>
